How to use openai Gpt-4 Vision API using PHP:

Prepare for the Journey: 
Replace "Path to the image" with the actual path to your image. Make sure it's accessible by the script.

Offer Your Credentials: 
Replace "Your OpenAI API key" with your actual OpenAI API key. Without it, the digital spirits will not heed your call.

Perform the Ritual: 
Run this script on a server with PHP and curl installed. It could be your local machine, a remote server, or a hosting environment that supports PHP.

Interpret the Oracle's Message: 
The script outputs a JSON response with the description and poem. Use it as you see fit, whether for enlightenment, entertainment, or edification.

 Good luck, brave soul. May your path be clear and your API key valid.
